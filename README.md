# Sleep Disorder Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze lifestyle and health data to predict sleep disorders, including Insomnia and Sleep Apnea. By identifying individuals at risk, it can support interventions to improve sleep quality and overall health.

## Dataset Description
The **Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset** contains data on 400 individuals, capturing various health and lifestyle metrics:

- **Sleep Metrics**: Includes sleep duration, quality, and factors influencing sleep patterns.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Physical activity, stress levels, and BMI.
- **Cardiovascular Health**: Blood pressure and heart rate, which may correlate with sleep disorders.
- **Sleep Disorder**: Labelled categories of "None," "Insomnia," or "Sleep Apnea."

## Impact
This project provides insights into factors contributing to sleep disorders and builds a predictive model to identify at-risk individuals, promoting better sleep health and overall well-being.
